The =%<nop>PHOTOGALLERY%= [[%SYSTEMWEB%.Macros][macro]] is handled by the PhotoGalleryPlugin.

---++ Parameters

%TABLE{ sort="off" tablerules="all" }%
| *Parameter*  | *Description*  | *Default*  \
|
| ="..."= or%BR% =images=  \
| Selects the images (attachments) to use for the gallery. \
Multiple selections can be given by separating them with a comma (=selection1,selection2,...,selectionN=). \
Each selection can be:%BR% \
- =/regex/=: a case insensitive [[%SYSTEMWEB%.RegularExpression][regular expression]] enclosed in dashes,%BR% \
- =name=: an attachment name, or%BR% \
- =name1..name2=: a range extracted from the alphabetically sorted list of all attachments, or%BR% \
- =name1--name2=: a range extracted from the list of all attachments ordered by attachment date%BR%  \
| ="/.jpe?g$/"= %BR%i.e. all attachements%BR%with _.jpg_ or _.jpeg_ %BR%(any case) extension  \
|
| =web= and%BR% =topic=  \
| The web and topic to use the attachments from. The parameters will be normalised, i.e. =topic= can be in the form _web.topic_.  \
| current web%BR% and topic  \
|
| =size=  \
| Sets the size in pixels for the thumbnails (50..500).  \
| 150 %RED%<sup>1</sup>%ENDCOLOR%  \
|
| =lazy=  \
| Selects when the thumbnails are created: %BR% \
- =on= uses the [[PhotoGalleryPlugin#Thumbnail_REST_Service][rest]] interface after the topic is rendered. %BR% \
- =off= creates the thumbnails as part of the original request. \
| =on= %RED%<sup>1</sup>%ENDCOLOR%  \
|
| =quality=  \
| Sets the thumbnail quality factor (1..100).  \
| 85 %RED%<sup>1</sup>%ENDCOLOR%  \
|
| =sort=  \
| Selects how to sort the selected attachments (=date=, =name=, =random= or =off=). Prefix with "-" to reverse the order (=-date=, =-name=). Sort on name is case-insensitive. \
| =date=  \
|
| =width=  \
| Selects how many thumbnails to show in one row (=0= = auto, i.e. as many as there is space).  \
| =0=  \
|
| =float=  \
| Float gallery on the =left= or =right= (only if =width= > 0) or keep gallery centred (=none=).  \
| =none=  \
|
| =remaining=  \
| Filter-out photos already used by previous galleries (in the same topic) (=on= or =off=).  \
| =off=  \
|
| =quiet=  \
| Do not complain if no images matched the =images= spec (=on= or =off=).  \
| =off=  \
|
| =unique=  \
| Remove duplicates due to overlapping selections (=on= or =off=).  \
| =on=  \
|
| =random=  \
| Randomly pick a number of images from the list of selected images.  \
| =0=  \
|
| =admin=  \
| Display admin action menu if the user has permissions (=on= or =off=) or is the owner of the attachment (=user=).  \
| =user= %RED%<sup>1</sup>%ENDCOLOR%  \
|
| =uidelay=  \
| Time in seconds until the caption and control elements disappear when idle. Set to 0 to disable hiding the user interface. \
| =4.0=  \
|
| =ssdelay=  \
| Slideshow delay between images in seconds.  \
| =5.0=  \
|
| =caption=  \
| Caption format specifier, a string with normal variables in the =$var= form and "magic" variables in the form =(pre)$var[fmt](post)=, where:%BR%  \
- =var= is the variable to expand,%BR%  \
- =fmt= is an optional formatting/scaling parameter for some variables, and%BR%  \
- =pre= and =post= are optional strings to prefix and postfix to the expanded variable if it expands to anything.%BR%  \
%BR%  \
In a first pass the following normal variables (=$var=) are expanded:%BR%  \
- =$percent=, =$percnt=, =$p=: Expand to a =%= character (for escaping other macros).%BR%  \
- =$BR=: Expands to a =%<nop>BR%= macro, which will insert a line break (=&lt;br/&gt;= HTML tag).%BR%  \
%BR%  \
Then the following magic variables (=var=) are expanded:%BR%  \
- =$n= and =$N=: The photo number and the total number of photos.%BR%  \
- =$name= and =$comment=: The attachment name and comment.%BR%  \
- =$CreateDate= and =$date=: The exposure time (if available from EXIF data) and the attachment date, respectively. \
  The optional =fmt= is a [[%SYSTEMWEB%.VarGMTIME][%<nop>GMTIME%]] style format string (with an appropriate default %RED%<sup>1</sup>%ENDCOLOR%).%BR%  \
- =$size=: The file size. The =fmt= parameter can be =MB= or =KB= to scale the size to mega and kilo bytes instead of bytes.%BR%  \
- =$ImageWidth= and =$ImageHeight=: The image dimensions in pixels.%BR%  \
- =$ImageSize=: An appropriately formatted image dimension string (e.g. "3000x2000 6MP").%BR%  \
- =$WikiName=: The wiki name of the attachment user.%BR%  \
- =$ExposureTime=, =$FocalLength=, =$ApertureValue=, =$ISO=: appropriately formatted camera parameters (if available from EXIF data).%BR%  \
- =$UserComment=, =$Make=, =$Model=: Unmodified EXIF data fields of the same name (if available).%BR% \
- =$MakeModel=: A sanitised concatenation of the "Make" and "Model" EXIF data fields (if available).%BR%  \
- =$Lat=, =$Lon=, and =$Alt=: geographic latitude, longitude and altitude in decimal degrees and metres (if available from EXIF data).%BR%  \
- =$Coords=: An appropriately formatted geographic location (coordinates) (if available from EXIF data).%BR%  \
%BR%  \
Lastly, multiple consecutive, leading and trailing =%<nop>BR%= (i.e. empty lines) will be removed. So you could use \
=$Comment$BR$CreateDate$BR$Coords= as a format and it would only produce the lines (breaks) neccessary.%BR%  \
| =$comment($BR&nbsp;)%BR%($n/$N,&nbsp;%BR%$CreateDate(,&nbsp;)%BR%$ExposureTime(,&nbsp;)%BR%$FocalLength(,&nbsp;)%BR%$ApertureValue(,&nbsp;)%BR%$ISO(,&nbsp;)%BR%$Coords(,&nbsp;)%BR%$MakeModel(,&nbsp;)%BR%$WikiName,&nbsp;%BR%$name,&nbsp;%BR%$ImageSize,&nbsp;%BR%$size(MB)[MB])= %RED%<sup>1</sup>%ENDCOLOR%   \
|
| =thumbcap=  \
| Caption format for thumbails if different from =caption= format. Set to =""= to disable thumbnail captions. \
| see =caption=  \
|
| =zoomcap=  \
| Caption format for zoomed photo view if different from =caption= format. Set to =""= to disable captions in viewer. \
| see =caption=  \
|
| =dayheading=  \
| Split gallery into sections by adding headings between different days.  \
Use =off= to disable inserting headings. Use a numerical, decimal hour of day  \
value to specify when a new day starts. E.g. =0= (or =on=) will consider  \
midnight and =3.5= will consider =03.30h= (half past three in the night) as the start of a new day. \
| =off=  \
|
| =headingfmt=  \
| A [[%SYSTEMWEB%.VarGMTIME][%<nop>GMTIME%]] style format string to format the  \
headings inserted by =dayheading=. It also expands the standard  \
%SYSTEMWEB%.FormatTokens (=$n= etc.)  \
| =$n---++ $wday $day $month $year$n= %RED%<sup>1</sup>%ENDCOLOR%  \
|

%RED%<sup>1</sup>%ENDCOLOR% These defaults depend on
[[PhotoGalleryPlugin#Plugin_Configuration_and_Defaults][plugin configuration defaults]].
Your administrator may have chosen to change these.

Multiple =%<nop>PHOTOGALLERY%= macros are allowed in the same topic.

---++ Admin Actions

Galleries renderd with the option =admin="user"= or =admin="on"= add a tools
menu to the thumbnails, if the user has permissions to change the attachment or
is the attachment's owner. A gear icon appears in the top right corner of such
thumbnails when hovering them with the mouse. The admin menu pops up when
hovering the gear icon. The following admin actions are available from the menu:

   * _rotate left_ and _rotate right_ rotate the photo by 90 degrees to the left
     and the right respectively. The rotation is lossless. These actions are only
     available for JPEG images.
   * _edit_ allows editing the attachment comment
   * _timestamp_ sets the attachment timestamp to the photo exposure time. The
     menu entry is only shown if the photo has the necessary EXIF data and if
     the attachment time differs from the exposure time.
   * _delete_ will delete the photo by moving it to the [[Trash.TrashAttachment]]
     topic (see also %SYSTEMWEB%.FileAttachment)
   * _move_ allows moving a photo to another topic. The provided dialog input
     field uses %SYSTEMWEB%.JQueryUIAutocomplete to suggest topic names as you
     type. By default it will look for topic names in the current web. If you
     specify the web sperated by a dot (e.g. "Main.searchtext") it will look in
     that web. If you prefix the search text with a dot (e.g. ".searchtext") it
     will look for matching topic names in all webs.
